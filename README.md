# About

This repo contains code for a Shiny app that I have embedded on my website [here](https://spencerschien.info/shiny/kayaking/). The functionality of the app is to produce a kayaking forecast for where I like to paddle. Data is sourced from the [National Weather Service's API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api#/).
